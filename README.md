# ai-project-template

[![Python 3.12](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.12-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/)

Welcome to the **AI Project Template** repository! This template is designed to **streamline the development** and **deployment** of AI/ML/MLOps/LLMOps projects. It provides a comprehensive setup for experiment tracking, model versioning, monitoring, tracing, and efficient project management, ensuring that all critical aspects of an AI project are covered.

## 🚀 Features Included

- **[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)**: CI/CD workflows for testing code, deploying models, running experiments, and more.
- **Config Directory**: Centralized configuration files for the project.
- **Data Directory**: Structured data management (raw, processed, and database data).
- **IaC Directory**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts for cloud deployment.
- **Notebooks Directory**: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and experiments.
- **Results Directory**: Store experiment results, logs, and models.
- **Source Code Directory**: Modularized source code for models, pipelines, utilities, schemas, and more.
- **Tests Directory**: Unit and integration tests using `pytest`.
- **[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)**: Configuration for linting, type checking, and secret detection.
- **[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)**: Setup for services like MLflow, OpenSearch, and more.
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)**: An extremely fast Python package and project manager
- **[pyproject.toml](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/build-system/pyproject-toml/)**: Config for project, ruff linter, formatter, type checking, and testing.


> [!NOTE]
> Not every element from this template is required for every project. Please adjust the repository structure and configuration files to fit your project's needs.

## 📁 Detailed Directory Breakdown

- **`/.github/`**: GitHub-specific configuration and workflows.
  - `/workflows/`: Contains CI/CD workflow definitions for automated testing, building, and deployment.
  - `dependabot.yaml`: Configuration for Dependabot to automatically update dependencies.

- **`/config/`**: Store all configuration files needed for your project.
  - Example: `config.yaml` can be used for setting up hyperparameters, API keys, or other environment variables.

- **`/data/`**: Structured data folders for different stages of the project.
  - `/raw/`: Raw data straight from the source.
  - `/processed/`: Cleaned and preprocessed data ready for use in models.
  - `/database/`: Database files if using local storage solutions.

- **`/iac/`**: Infrastructure as Code scripts for automating cloud deployments (e.g., AWS CloudFormation, Terraform).

- **`/notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), experimenting with models, and reporting.
  - Example: `00_example.ipynb` shows how a notebook looks in the project.

- **`/results/`**: Store experiment results, logs, and models.

- **`/src/`**: Main source code for your project.
  - `/constants/`: Store project-wide constants (e.g., file paths, API endpoints).
  - `/models/`: Machine learning models (e.g., neural networks, decision trees) scripts, classes, and functions.
  - `/schemas/`: Data schemas and validation logic (e.g., Pydantic models).
  - `/pipelines/`: Data and model pipelines.
  - `/utils/`: Utility functions and helpers (e.g., data loaders, preprocessing functions).
  - `main.py`: Main execution script for the project.

- **`/tests/`**: Unit and integration tests.

## ⚙️ Configuration Files

- **`.env`**: Store environment variables like API keys, database credentials, and sensitive information.

- **`.gitignore`**: Standard [`.gitignore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file to exclude unnecessary files (e.g., environment files, data files).

- **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`**: Configuration for [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks for linting, formatting, and type checking.

- **`docker-compose.yaml`**: A Docker Compose configuration to spin up services such as [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/), [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/), and more.

- **`pyproject.toml`**: Configuration of the project, plus the configuration for formatting and linting. This file is used by [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage the project and [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting.

- **`uv.lock`**: Lock file for [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager automatically generated by `uv` when installing packages.
